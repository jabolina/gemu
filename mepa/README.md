# mepa

A minimal project that offers a transport primitive backed by TCP.

The main purpose of this project is to abstract all complexity and offer a high level
communication primitive to be used by other projects. Here we are looking forward to offer
a simple TCP communication between a pair of peers, nothing too fancy.
